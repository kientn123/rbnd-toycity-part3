1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  2 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  I got to practice some functional programming style with select function of Array.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  I added find_by_customer and find_by_product to the Transaction class.
  They will help people find all the transactions purchased by a customer and
  all the transactions related to a specific product.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  There are plenty of room to grow. For example, two customers can purchase a
  product together. A discount can be added to a transaction.
